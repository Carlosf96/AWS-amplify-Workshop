## Customizing the Questions and Answers

You probably want to modify your questions and answers for your own game, let's take a look at how to add our own questions. First, navigate to the primary workshop directory `/aws-amplify-unicorntrivia-workshop/AdminPanel/src` 

Inside, there is a file named questions.json. This file stores the questions, answer choices, as well as correct answer all wrapped within a JSON object. You can easily modify the questions by changing the structure of this file. Open it, modify questions.json with your own custom questions, and save! You have now added new questions that can be push to the subscribers of your app. If your AdminPanel is still running in the terminal, you should also see the questions auto update in the browser window.

**Well Done!!!** [Click Here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-amplify-unicorntrivia-workshop/blob/master/documentation/wrap_up_doc.md) to conclude the session with the wrap up section.
